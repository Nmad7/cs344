Task #1 — What are the biases present in the given dataset?
There are more males than females in the dataset which could lead to bias, a good split would be 50/50. Race is heavily skewed towards
white in the data set.
Task #2 — Assess the potential bias in some other feature besides education level.
In regards to race, the data shows some bias in income bracket. For instance, the other race section has nearly no
representation in the above 50k data. Overall one of the biggest sources of bias that would show up in this dataset is that
it only covers those who work 1 or more hours, which leaves out a large amount of people in America who do not work.
Task #3 — Do as written.
Task #4 — Do you find disparities when you look at race rather than gender? If so, which way to they skew?
The data in race is heavily biased towards false negatives meaning the model tends to have more wrong predictions that
people make less than 50k. This is made worse by the accuracy disparities in race. The Amer-Indian-Eskimo category,
for instance, is a around 10% less accurate than Asian-Pac-Islander, Other, and White at 61.54%. Black also has low accuracy.
