Task 1: Is a linear model ever preferable to a deep NN model?
A linear model definitely can be preferable in some instances. While a deep Neural Network can model every
linear model, it is often overkill to use a deep Neural Network as it would take more parameters to do the
same thing. It is sometimes faster and easier to use a linear model for a linear problem.
Task 2: Does the NN model do better than the linear model?
The NN model seems to have varying performance when trained multiple times but overall it seems to do a little better.
Task 3: Do embeddings do much good for sentiment analysis tasks?
They do not seem to do significantly better than the linear model.
Tasks 4â€“5: Name two words that have similar embeddings and explain why that makes sense.
Disappointing and boring seem to have similar embeddings over multiple trainings of the model for me. This would make
sense as they would be used in similar situations in sentences to describe a negative sentiment towards a movie. Both words represent
that the reviewer thinks the overall movie is that thing.
Task 6: Report your best hyper-parameters and their resulting performance.
I used the full word list using Adam with a learning rate of .005, two hidden layers of 128 and 64, and steps=2500 resulted
in a test accuracy of 87.104%.
