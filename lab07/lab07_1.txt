a.
exercise 1:
cities['Saint_And_Over_50miles'] = cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith("San")) & cities['Area square miles'].apply(lambda size:size > 50)

exercise 2:
cities.reindex([2,0,1,5])
This kind of behavior is allowed because often when pulling from real data sources there will often be indexes that can be missing their
corresponding data. This allows for inserting real data with missing parts without having to first clean up the outside list. Furthermore when
expanding the data to cover a larger data range reindex will allow us to expand but not fill everything with new data.

b.
Compared to numpy, the pandas dataframe with labeled columns allows us to keep track of data more easily. Overall, when dealing
with data sets (especially when not just numerical) pandas seems more user friendly and readable. It is also possible to use pandas series
with numpy allowing both to be combined.

c.
It would be useful to reorder Pandas data in many situations. For one, reorder the data can
allow us to put it in a certain order, for instance by date/time or alphabetical. Reordering randomly can be
useful in machine learning in order to not test on a data set that is ordered in a specific way which may
influence the end AI.
