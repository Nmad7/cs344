1. Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data
Categorical data is descriptive data that puts the data into a category with examples like: country, house style, or race. Numerical data,
on the other hand, is simply data that is a number such as salary or views of a page.
2. Submit solutions to tasks 1–2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and the resulting RMSE, but not the training output.
Task1: train_model(learning_rate=0.00002,steps=500,batch_size=5)  RMSE = 166.53
Task2: train_model(learning_rate=.000055,steps=375,batch_size=100,input_feature="population") RMSE = 175.98

3. What are the hyper-parameters learned in these exercises and is there a “standard” tuning algorithm for them? Explain your answer.
Learning rate is related to the magnitude of updates to the weights of the model. Steps are the amount of times the batch size is
fed into the system. Batch size is the amount of data given at one time. There is no one tuning algorithm to figure out what to use, only
guidelines. Each data set and data set type does better with different arguments.
