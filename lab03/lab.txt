nqueens depth first has issues
set a max steps to see where it dies (around 100) on the 8x8
ac3 fails in nqueens if theres too many options (it has to be constrained)
forward searching narrows the search space

Exercise 3.1
a.
For the solved sudoku problem all algorithms arrive work very fast. In the easy problem the only algorithm that can
arrive at the solution is AC-3 but all of the other algorithms cannot solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.
For the harder and hardest problem no algorithms are capable of solving them.
TODO:ADD MORE ABOUT capabilities of algorithsms

b.
If in the backtracking search the select_unassigned_variable parameter was changed to MRV,
