1. Which of the local search algorithms solves the problem? How well does each algorithm do?
Both of the local search algorithms solves the problem correctly. Each algorithm finds the exact maximum of the graph.
2. Which algorithm works more quickly?
Hill climbing solves the problem more quickly than annealing solution.
3. Does the starting value for x make any difference? Why or why not?
The starting should not
4. What affect does changing the delta step value make on each algorithm? Why?
As the delta tells each algorithm how far to jump each time on the graph, making
the delta very small means the algorithms have to make a large amount of small jumps
to make it to the maximum of the graph extending the time it takes to get to the max.
The algorithms will not also not find the max if, by only jumping by that, the max is unattainable.
5. What is the purpose of the exp_schedule() method in the simulated annealing function call?
