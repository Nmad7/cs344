1. Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?
I would rather use Keras to build models. Generally it seems like in TensorFlow you have to create the same long code
nearly the same every time whereas in Keras that code is shortened and simplified.

2. Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.
Task 1:
 learning_rate=0.002,
    steps=3500,
    batch_size=60,
    hidden_units=[12, 6]
 Gives a RMSE of 103.57 on the testing data and 102.53 on the validation data.
Task 2:
A final RMSE of 101.54.
